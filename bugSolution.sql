To avoid implicit type conversion issues, always use explicit type casting when necessary. This ensures predictable behavior and prevents unexpected errors.  The correct way to concatenate a string and number is to explicitly convert the number to a string using the appropriate function for your database system (e.g., CAST() or CONVERT()). The solution also addresses the problem of using string functions on numeric columns without explicit casting, this is done with explicit type casting before any operations with string functions.

```sql
SELECT CAST('1' AS UNSIGNED) + 1; -- Explicit conversion, avoids issues
SELECT CAST(numeric_column AS VARCHAR) || ' some text'; -- Explicit casting for string operations
```

Ensure that your SQL functions are using correct data types for their input and output. Use explicit type casting whenever you combine different data types in SQL expressions to reduce the risk of implicit conversion errors. Always test your code thoroughly after making any changes and add appropriate error handling where necessary.
