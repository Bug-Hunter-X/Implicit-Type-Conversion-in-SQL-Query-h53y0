The SQL query uses a function that implicitly converts a string to a number, which may lead to unexpected results due to type coercion. For example, using the '+' operator to concatenate strings might produce unexpected results if one operand is a numeric type and the other is a string type.  In some databases, this behavior may lead to unexpected truncation or conversion errors. Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT '1' + 1; -- May return 2, but may fail or produce unexpected result in some DBs
```

Another example is using string functions on numeric columns without explicit casting, which can lead to implicit type conversions with potential data loss or errors.
