This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving implicit type conversions and provides a solution using explicit type casting. The `bug.sql` file shows a query that leads to unexpected results due to implicit type coercion. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version using explicit type casting to avoid the issue. The problem is detailed in the bug description and a more thorough explanation of the problem and its solution is in `bugContent` and `solutionContent` respectively.
